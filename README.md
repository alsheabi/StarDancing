# More Details:

Imagine that you are having a night trip in the park and when you look up you find that the stars are dancing in imitation of the movements of a masterful dancer. Then you⋅⋅ think that it is a moving painting in the sky.
Star Dancing is elevating the discussion on the relationship between humans and AI to another level. One of the main goals is to interact with AI, to feel the presence of neural networks – in a playful way.
